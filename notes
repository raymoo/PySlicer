- Python Tutor gives line events, but multiple statements can be on the same

  Tutor will assign to it.
- Test-Control will be a little bit more complicated in the presence of early
  return.
- I saw that a paper "Dynamic Slicing of Python Programs" exists, but I can only
  find it behind paywalls.
